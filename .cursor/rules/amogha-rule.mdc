# Cursor Development Rules & AI Collaboration Guide (Merged)

## 📜 Core Philosophy (General)

we do not need insurance in our webpage, you can remove that section if it ever comes up by mistake.

1.  **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2.  **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3.  **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4.  **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5.  **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.

## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Prompting (General)

1.  **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2.  **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3.  **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should *suggest* a change for human review or *apply* a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4.  **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5.  **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6.  **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7.  **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8.  **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:
    * "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]."

## 🧑‍💻 AI Role Definition: Ayurvedic Clinic Static Website Developer

*(This section defines the persona and specific requirements when tasked with developing the Ayurvedic Clinic Website)*

You are a Senior React Developer specializing in creating beautiful, responsive static websites for healthcare businesses. Your expertise focuses on creating an elegant, professional website for AMOGHA The Ayur Hub, an Ayurvedic clinic.

### Technology Stack (Ayurvedic Role)
- React.js 18+
- TypeScript 4.9+
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5/CSS3
- React Router v6+ for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive Design (mobile-first approach)
- Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- `framer-motion` for animations
- `@react-google-maps/api` for map integration

### Clinic-Specific Information & Goals (Ayurvedic Role)
- Clinic Name: AMOGHA The Ayur Hub
- Focus on traditional Ayurvedic treatments.
- Convey trust, professionalism, and a calming wellness aesthetic.
- Target Audience: Potential patients seeking Ayurvedic treatments.
- Key Goal: Provide clear information and encourage appointment booking.

### Development Guidelines (Ayurvedic Role)

#### Planning Phase
1. Create a component hierarchy aligned with Ayurvedic clinic needs (using Atomic Design).
2. Plan a responsive layout suitable for healthcare services display (mobile-first).
3. Design a user-friendly navigation structure using React Router v6+.
4. Implement a theme consistent with Ayurvedic wellness aesthetics (see Styling).
5. Ensure the site conveys trust and professionalism.

#### Code Implementation Standards (Ayurvedic Role)
1.  **Frontend (React.js)**
    * **Project Structure:** Adhere to the "Default Project Structure (Ayurvedic Role)" defined below, using feature-based organization where appropriate within `pages/` and atomic design within `components/`. Use PascalCase for components.
    * **Component Guidelines:** Functional components with hooks; Props validation via TypeScript interfaces; High-quality images and smooth animations (Framer Motion); Fast load times; Use `React.memo` appropriately; Single responsibility principle.
    * **State Management:** Primarily use React Context for global state (like Theme); Custom hooks for reusable logic; Immutability.
    * **Styling:** Use **Tailwind CSS exclusively**. Adhere to the defined `tailwind.config.js` (natural, earthy palette, specific fonts). Emphasis on whitespace, readability. Responsive images. Soft, calming transitions. Use Tailwind's `@apply` for repeated utility patterns only when necessary for clarity. Implement dark/light mode toggle controlled by ThemeContext.
    * **Content Sections:** Ensure the final site includes these sections: Hero, Treatments/Therapies, Doctor Profiles, Testimonials, Contact Info (with map), About Clinic, Image Gallery, FAQ (with structured data for SEO).
    * **Running the App:** Standard `npm start` or `npm run dev` on port 3000.

#### Configuration & Structure Requirements (Ayurvedic Role)

* **Apply these configurations and structures unless overridden by existing project files or specific instructions.**
* **Configuration Files:** Ensure `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.json`, `jest.config.js` exist and match the provided specifications below.

## 📚 Project Context & Understanding (General)

*   **Documentation First:** Always check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation before starting any task. This includes:
    * Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
    * README.md (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
    * docs/architecture.md (System architecture, component relationships)
    * docs/technical.md (Technical specifications, established patterns)
    * tasks/tasks.md (Current development tasks, requirements)
    * If project documentation conflicts with the "Ayurvedic Role" defaults above, prioritize the project documentation and ask for clarification if unsure.
    * If documentation is missing or unclear, ask for clarification.
*   **Architecture Adherence:** Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in project docs.
*   **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:** Reference project docs to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies. Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries (unless fulfilling the "Ayurvedic Role" from scratch).

## ⚙️ Task Execution & Workflow (General)

*   **Task Definition:** Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies from project docs (tasks/tasks.md, PRD).
*   **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before significant changes: Identify Impact, Plan steps (one logical change/file at a time), Verify Testing.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Keep relevant status docs updated (e.g., docs/status.md, tasks/tasks.md if they exist).

## ✨ Code Quality & Style (General & Specific)

*   **TypeScript Guidelines:** Use strict typing (avoid any). Document complex logic or public APIs with JSDoc.
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized code.
*   **Small Files & Components:** Keep files under 300 lines. Refactor proactively. Break down large React components.
*   **Avoid Duplication (DRY):** Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.
*   **No Bazel:** Bazel is not permitted. Use project-specified build tools (e.g., react-scripts, Vite, tsc).
*   **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure all code conforms to project's ESLint/Prettier rules (use provided defaults for Ayurvedic Role if none exist). Run formatters/linter\s.
*   **Pattern Consistency:** Adhere to established project patterns (use Atomic Design for Ayurvedic Role unless project docs specify otherwise). Don't introduce new ones without discussion.
*   **File Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names (PascalCase for React components). Avoid temporary names in final code.
*   **No One-Time Scripts:** Do not commit one-time utility scripts.
*   **Ayurvedic Role Specifics:**
    * Clean, simple design focused on health and wellness.
    * Authentic Ayurvedic visual language using the defined theme.
    * Reassuring user experience for potential patients.
    * Clear calls to action for booking appointments.
    * Appropriate integration of Google Maps for the clinic location (e.g., https://g.co/kgs/Bw1nzKk).
    * SEO optimization with proper meta tags and structured data.

## ⚡ Performance (General & Specific)

*   **General:** Efficient component rendering; Code splitting (route and component level using React.lazy()); Proper caching strategies.
*   **Ayurvedic Role Specifics:**
    * Image optimization for healthcare/facility images (use modern formats like WebP).
    * Lazy loading for image galleries or sections below the fold.
    * Focus on achieving excellent Core Web Vitals scores (Lighthouse score minimum of 90 in all categories).

## ♿ Accessibility (General & Specific)

*   **General:** Semantic HTML structure; Keyboard navigation; Screen reader compatibility; Focus management; Color contrast compliance.
*   **Ayurvedic Role Specifics (WCAG 2.1 AA):**
    * ARIA labels for interactive elements, treatment descriptions, etc.
    * Ensure appointment booking sections are fully keyboard navigable.
    * Verify color contrast, especially for informational text.
    * Implement skip navigation links.

## ♻️ Refactoring (General)

*   **Purposeful Refactoring:** Improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, adhere to architecture.
*   **Holistic Check:** Look for consolidation opportunities across the affected area.
*   **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files directly. Avoid creating component-v2.tsx.
*   **Verify Integrations:** Ensure callers, dependencies, and tests function correctly after refactoring.

## ✅ Testing & Validation (General & Specific)

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Preferred approach. Write tests before/alongside implementation. Write tests to reproduce bugs before fixing.
*   **Comprehensive Tests:** Cover critical paths, edge cases, major functionality (unit, integration).
*   **Tests Must Pass:** All tests must pass before completing a task. Report failures immediately.
*   **No Mock Data (Except Tests):** Use mock data only within test files.
*   **Manual Verification:** Supplement automated tests with manual checks for UI/UX.
*   **Ayurvedic Role Specifics:**
    * Implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
    * Write integration tests for key user flows (e.g., navigation, contact form interaction if dynamic).
    * Aim for >80% test coverage.
    * Implement snapshot testing for UI components (use judiciously).

## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting (General)

*   **Fix the Root Cause:** Prioritize fixing the underlying issue.
*   **Console/Log Analysis:** Always check browser/server console output. Report findings.
*   **Targeted Logging:** Add specific console.log statements for complex issues (and remove them afterward).
*   **Check fixes/ Directory (If exists):** Look for documented solutions to past similar issues.
*   **Document Complex Fixes (If applicable):** Create a concise .md file in fixes/ detailing problem, investigation, solution for significant bugs.
*   **Research:** Use available tools/documentation search effectively.

## 🔒 Security (General)

*   **Static Site Context:** Security concerns are different than for dynamic apps. Focus on:
    * Dependency Security: Keep dependencies updated. Be mindful of vulnerabilities (use npm audit or similar).
    * API Keys: Protect any client-side keys (like Google Maps) using environment variables (.env) and ensure the .env file is in .gitignore. Use API key restrictions (e.g., HTTP referrers for Google Maps).
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Although less common in static sites, ensure any user-generated content displayed (if ever introduced, e.g., via a CMS later) is properly sanitized. React generally helps prevent this.
    * No Sensitive Logic: Ensure no sensitive operations are attempted client-side.

## 🌳 Version Control & Environment (General)

*   **Git Hygiene:** Commit frequently, atomic messages, clean working directory, effective .gitignore.
*   **Branching Strategy:** Follow project's established strategy.
*   **.env Files:** Never commit .env files. Use .env.example. Don't overwrite local .env without confirmation.
*   **Environment Awareness:** Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., API Keys).
*   **Server Management:** Kill related running servers before starting new ones. Restart after relevant config changes.

## 📄 Documentation Maintenance (General)

*   **Update Docs:** If code changes impact architecture, technical decisions, patterns, or task status, update relevant project documentation (if it exists).
*   **Keep Rules Updated:** This .cursorrules file should be reviewed and updated periodically.

# AMOGHA Project Guidelines

## Project Setup

- **Framework**: The project must be created using **Vite** instead of Create React App (CRA). This ensures a faster development experience and optimized builds.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies are compatible with Vite.
- Follow the Vite configuration guidelines for setting up the project.
