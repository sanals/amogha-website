## üîß Setup & Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amogha.git
   cd amogha
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file and add your Google Maps API key.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Download placeholder images (for development):
   ```
   node scripts/download-sample-images.js
   ```

6. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website

### Project Structure

- `/public` - Static assets like images and fonts
- `/src` - Source code
  - `/components` - React components using Atomic Design principles
  - `/pages` - Page components
  - `/data` - Data files for treatments, doctors, etc.
  - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
  - `/context` - React context providers
  - `/types` - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `/utils` - Utility functions

## üìù Content Management

The website content is stored in structured data files:

- `src/data/departmentsData.ts` - Information about departments
- `src/data/treatmentsData.ts` - Treatment details
- `src/data/doctorsData.ts` - Doctor profiles
- `src/data/testimonialsData.ts` - Patient testimonials

Update these files to modify the website content.

## üèûÔ∏è Image Assets

Images are organized in the `/public/images` directory:

- `/hero` - Hero banner images
- `/departments` - Department-related images
- `/treatments` - Treatment-related images
- `/team` - Doctor and staff photos
- `/gallery` - Facility and general photos
- `/testimonials` - Testimonial photos

Use consistent image dimensions for each category as specified in the image directories' README files.

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is designed with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints:

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## üõ†Ô∏è Build for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Run the pre-build optimization script
2. Optimize all images to WebP format in multiple sizes
3. Generate an updated sitemap
4. Update the service worker cache
5. Create an optimized production build

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` directory.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

This project implements multiple performance optimization techniques:

- **Image Optimization**: Converts images to WebP, creates responsive sizes, and lazy loads them
- **Code Splitting**: Separates vendor code and implements route-based code splitting
- **CSS Optimization**: Purges unused CSS and implements critical CSS loading
- **Font Optimization**: Preloads critical fonts and implements font-display swap
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements service worker with smart caching strategies
- **Animation Optimization**: Uses Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations
- **SEO Component**: Comprehensive meta tags and structured data

For detailed information, see [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

### Performance Scripts

Several scripts are available for performance management:

```
npm run optimize-images    # Convert and optimize all images
npm run generate-sitemap   # Generate a sitemap.xml file
npm run pre-build          # Run all optimization steps
```

## üåê Deployment

The static website can be deployed to any hosting service that supports static sites:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Firebase Hosting
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
