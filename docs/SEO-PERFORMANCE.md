# AMOGHA SEO & Performance Optimization Summary

This document summarizes all the SEO and performance optimizations implemented for the AMOGHA The Ayur Hub website.

## SEO Optimizations

### 1. Reusable SEO Component

Added a comprehensive SEO component (`src/components/atoms/SEO.tsx`) that:
- Manages title, description, and keywords meta tags
- Provides Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Implements Twitter Card tags for Twitter sharing
- Supports canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
- Includes structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets

### 2. Structured Data

- **Service Schema**: Each treatment has structured data with details about the Ayurvedic service
- **MedicalBusiness Schema**: Complete business information for rich Google knowledge panels
- **BreadcrumbList Schema**: Navigation structure for improved search results
- **FAQPage Schema**: FAQ sections with structured data for featured snippets

### 3. Sitemap Generation

Implemented a sitemap generator (`scripts/generate-sitemap.js`) that:
- Creates a comprehensive XML sitemap of all pages
- Includes priority and change frequency attributes
- Gets updated with each production build

### 4. Metadata Strategy

- Consistent title format: `Page Title | AMOGHA The Ayur Hub`
- Unique meta descriptions for each page focusing on Ayurvedic keywords
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 â†’ H6) throughout the site
- Alt text for all images with descriptive content

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

- **WebP Conversion**: All images are converted to the modern WebP format (scripts/optimize-images.js)
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple sizes created for different viewports
- **LazyImage Component**: Loads images only when they enter viewport
- **ResponsiveImage Component**: Advanced responsive image loading with WebP support
- **Image Optimization Build Plugin**: Additional optimization during build

### 2. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

- Route-based code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense
- Vendor code separated into its own chunk
- Only essential components loaded on initial render
- HomePage eagerly loaded for fastest initial paint

### 3. CSS Optimization

- TailwindCSS optimization with PurgeCSS
- Critical CSS inlined in the head
- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
- Theme constants for consistent styling

### 4. Animation Performance

- **AnimateOnScroll**: Optimized scroll-based animations
- **PageTransition**: Smooth transitions between routes
- Uses IntersectionObserver API to minimize main thread work
- Animation optimizations in Framer Motion

### 5. Font Optimization

- Preconnect to font servers
- Preload critical fonts
- Font-display: swap for text visibility during loading
- Limited font variants to essential styles

### 6. Caching Strategy

- Service worker implementation for offline support
- Smart caching strategies based on content type
- Precaching of critical resources
- Cache management during updates

## Core Web Vitals Optimization

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- Critical images are preloaded
- Responsive images delivered at optimal sizes
- Server response time optimized
- Critical CSS inlined

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- Image dimensions specified in advance
- Font display swap to prevent layout shifts
- Reserved space for dynamic content
- Stable UI elements during loading

### First Input Delay (FID)

- Main thread work minimized
- JavaScript execution optimized
- Third-party scripts deferred when possible
- Event handlers debounced

## Build Process Integration

Performance optimization is integrated into the build process:

1. `npm run pre-build`: Runs all optimization tasks
   - Optimizes images to WebP formats
   - Generates sitemap
   - Updates service worker cache
2. `npm run build`: Production build with all optimizations

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Web Vitals reporting implementation
- Performance monitoring integration
- SEO performance tracking

## Future Optimization Plans

- Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) for external resources
- Further optimize third-party scripts
- Consider implementing cache API for dynamic content
- Add automated performance testing in CI pipeline
